# Star Players Project

## Overview
"Star Players" is an feature idea I developed to tackle the issue of playlist redundancy commonly experienced in digital music platforms. This project was inspired by a personal challenge: managing multiple playlist versions—one comprehensive for variety and another condensed with favorites for specific listening scenarios. "Star Players" simplifies this by allowing users to highlight and manage their favorite tracks directly within any playlist.

## Motivation
The idea for "Star Players" emerged from the need for a more intuitive way to handle playlists during different listening experiences. Traditionally, users like myself found it necessary to maintain dual playlists—resulting in unnecessary duplication and management overhead. This feature aims to reduce this redundancy by integrating a simple yet powerful control that allows users to switch between full playlist views and a curated set of favorite tracks.

## Functionality
The application integrates a unique "StarPlay" button within a standard music player interface that includes play, pause, skip, and shuffle functions. This button enables users to toggle between all songs and their selected 'Star Players,' thereby offering a personalized listening experience. This makes it ideal for anyone looking to enjoy their favorite songs without the hassle of switching between different playlist versions.

Of course, this is just a simple demo of my idea, but I hope you agree with me that this is a feature we should see added to our favourite music platforms! Feel free to take a look at the code or check out the final project at https://confinlay.github.io/home/
