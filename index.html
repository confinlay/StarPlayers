          When you curate a playlist, every song has its place, whether it's for background ambiance or your absolute favorites that never fail to get you singing along.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, we've all been there—scrolling through our playlists, seeking out those favorites for a quick mood boost, or when we want to share our top picks with friends.
        </p>
        <p class="problem-statement">
          The other option? You create multiple versions of the same playlist: one for those times when you need an extensive mix, and another pared-down to just the essentials.
        </p>
        <p class="solution-highlight">
          What if you didn't have to duplicate playlists anymore?
        </p>
        <p>
          What if you could have your cake and eat it too—enjoy the full array of your carefully chosen tunes and, with a simple tap, switch to a list of your favorites within that very playlist?
        </p>
        <p class="call-to-action">
          Say goodbye to playlist redundancy and hello to effortless control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your favorite tracks are now just a star away from taking center stage, without the clutter of multiple playlists.
        </p>
        <p class="teaser">
          With this new feature, it's your music, your rules—enjoy it your way, every time.

        <h1>Introducing: Star Players</h1>
        <p>
          As part of my application for Spotify, I've developed this (very) simple web app to introduce my feature concept: "Star Players". 
          Think of it as a VIP-section for your playlists.
        </p>
        <p>
          This feature lets you take the reins and choose your personal hits from any playlist you've curated.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the app demo below, you'll find the usual music player functions: play, pause, skip, and shuffle.
        </p>
        <p class="solution-highlight">
          Here's the new headliner: the StarPlay button.
        </p>
        <p>
          It works alongside the shuffle function, allowing you to toggle between playing all songs or just your 'Star Players'—the songs you've marked as your top picks.
        </p>
        <p class="call-to-action">
          With StarPlay, you're the DJ, curating the beats that deserve the spotlight on your personal stage.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          PS: Rest easy, all tunes here are copyright-free and ready for your mixing.
